            <p>  Hello! I am majoring in New Media Development at RIT. I am hoping to get a job in interactive media, particularly games or VR. I believe that educational interactive media has the potential for creating positive change&mdash; building empathy through immersive experiences. I really enjoy narrative-focused RPGs, especially games focused on portraying underrepresented communities or based on historical events.

        <h2>QUEER: IT'S NOT A BAD WORD</h2>
        <h3><em>nonfiction visual novel</em> about the Queer community: 2021-present</h3>

        <div>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/queernotabadwordgame/" target="_blank">Queer: It's Not A Bad Word</a> is a game about queer identity, queer history, and queer community.
                The game is an educational text-based RPG based on interviews with real people. In the game, you can
                explore New York City, Rochester, and Washington, D.C. and talk to people you encounter along the way.
                In your travels you will hear the stories of eight different people of different ages, identities, and backgrounds.

                This project aims to increase awareness of the queer community-- our culture, our experiences, and our many varied
                members-- for those in the community and for our allies. Representation is important and what is better representation
                than the stories of real people?
            
                I began working on this project in my freshman year at RIT. It was not created for a class assignment, it is purely a passion project.
                I have done all of the interviewing, writing, and coding work myself, and I have gotten help from friends and classmates to create the art.
                The game is a work in progress and so far has been developed using Twine, a text-based game engine for branching narratives.
                I plan to eventually release the game on itch.io.

        <h2>OCEAN CLEAN UP</h2>
        <h3><em>Arcade-style</em> game made with <em>JavaScript and PIXI.js</em>: 2023</h3>

        <div>
        <p>I made <a href="https://people.rit.edu/ras5491/235/Web-Apps/project-3/index.html">this game</a> for RIT's Interactive Design and Problem Solving course. I built off of a game project I had developed in an earlier course, 
            with more robust graphics and code functionality this time. I was able to implement more features that I had wanted to include originally but due to time constraints and my coding knowledge were outside the scope of the project.
            The game was made using Javascript and HTML as well as a JS library called PIXI.js which supports browser game development.
            In the game, the player controls a diver collecting plastic in the ocean. The objective is to collect as much plastic as you can within a minute.
            You can move the divers with your mouse. Moving the diver over a piece of trash automatically collects the trash and adds to your score based on the type of trash.
            You get more points for collecting plastic trash.

        <h2>DEMONIC DESTRUCTION</h2>
        <h3><em>2D Roguelike</em> made in <em>Unity</em>: 2020 </h3>
        
        <div>
        <p>In the summer of 2020 I took an online course at New York University on game design and development in Unity.
            I worked as part of a three-member team to design and program a top-down
            fantasy roguelike game using Unity and C#. In the game, you play as a wizard who is tasked with
            eliminating demons from the world and you must fight these demons using your elemental powers.
            I led the team in the completion of the game's level design and audio design. In practice this meant finding backgroud music
            that we could use under Creative Commons, and finding and then implementing the right sprites for the background as well as for some of the characters.
            A prototype of the game was built
            within about a week, from deciding on a game concept to completing the final build.
