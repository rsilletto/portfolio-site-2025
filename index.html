      <div class="container" id="flex"> 
            <p>  Hello! I am majoring in New Media Development at RIT. I am hoping to get a job in interactive media, particularly games or VR. I believe that educational interactive media has the potential for creating positive change&mdash; building empathy through immersive experiences. I really enjoy narrative-focused RPGs, especially games focused on portraying underrepresented communities or based on historical events.

        <h2>QUEER: IT'S NOT A BAD WORD</h2>
        <h3>Nonfiction visual novel about the Queer community: 2021-present</h3>

        <div>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/queernotabadwordgame/" target="_blank">Queer: It's Not A Bad Word</a> is a game about queer identity, queer history, and queer community.
                The game is an educational text-based RPG based on interviews with real people. In the game, you can
                explore New York City, Rochester, and Washington, D.C. and talk to people you encounter along the way.
                In your travels you will hear the stories of eight different people of different ages, identities, and backgrounds.

                This project aims to increase awareness of the queer community-- our culture, our experiences, and our many varied
                members-- for those in the community and for our allies. Representation is important and what is better representation
                than the stories of real people?
            
                I began working on this project in my freshman year at RIT. It was not created for a class assignment, it is purely a passion project.
                I have done all of the interviewing, writing, and coding work myself, and I have gotten help from friends and classmates to create the art.
                The game is a work in progress and was originally developed using Twine and ink, text-based game engines for branching narratives. I have begun porting the game into Unity using a plugin library that supports integration with ink.
                I plan to eventually release the game on itch.io.

        <h2><em>echoes</em> WEB DEVELOPMENT TEAM</h2>
        <h3>Updated and maintained site using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Svelte: 2025 </h3>
        
        <div>
        <p>The VIP Program engages both undergraduate and graduate students in faculty-led multidisciplinary project teams.
          <em>echoes</em> is a credit-bearing student-led, student-run project at Rochester Institute of Technology exploring how 
          developing and playing games can cultivate shared understanding and foster meaningful connections.
       
        As part of the web development team, I collaborated with other students using agile production methods to develop and maintain
        <a href="https://www.echoes-vip.org/" target="_blank">the <em>echoes</em> website</a>, which promotes and hosts student-created games. I completed tasks which were organized and assigned via GitHub Taskboard.
        I contributed code to the site's pages using Svelte, Tailwind, and NodeJS.

        <h2>CENTENNIAL SCULPTURE PARK WALK</h2>
        <h3>Augmented Reality experience made with AR.js and Locar.js: 2025 </h3>
        
        <div>
        <p>The goal of <a href="https://rcal.ccastellanos.com/centennial-sculpture-park-walk/" target="_blank">this project</a> was to create an interactive and informative experience at the 
          Rochester Memorial Art Gallery's Centennial Sculpture Park. The Scultpure Park is a free to access 
          public space where just about anyone can come to see fine art. I worked as part of a team with 3 other students to develop the project.
          After looking into the park more and visiting it for ourselves, 
          we found that most of the information about the park's sculptures was hidden away on the MAG's website, and unlikely to be found 
          by anyone walking around the park. So, we decided to make that information quickly and easily accessible via AR objects that when clicked or tapped 
          open up a UI that shows information about the sculptures that can typically only be found on the website. 
          The project's code uses location tracking to give users information about nearby sculptures, which can be accessed via red boxes that appear next to the appropriate sculpture.
          By doing this, we hoped to make the park more interactive and engaging by providing a unique way to learn more about these sculptures.

        <h2>OCEAN CLEAN UP</h2>
        <h3>Arcade-style game made with JavaScript and PIXI.js: 2023</h3>

        <div>
        <p>I made <a href="https://people.rit.edu/ras5491/235/Web-Apps/project-3/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this game</a> for RIT's Interactive Design and Problem Solving course. I built off of a game project I had developed in an earlier course, 
            with more robust graphics and code functionality this time. I was able to implement more features that I had wanted to include originally but due to time constraints and my coding knowledge were outside the scope of the project.
            The game was made using Javascript and HTML as well as a JS library called PIXI.js which supports browser game development.
            In the game, the player controls a diver collecting plastic in the ocean. The objective is to collect as much plastic as you can within a minute.
            You can move the divers with your mouse. Moving the diver over a piece of trash automatically collects the trash and adds to your score based on the type of trash.
            You get more points for collecting plastic trash.

        <h2>DEMONIC DESTRUCTION</h2>
        <h3><em>2D Roguelike</em> made in <em>Unity</em>: 2020 </h3>
        
        <div>
        <p>In the summer of 2020 I took an online course at New York University on game design and development in Unity.
            I worked as part of a three-member team to design and program a top-down
            fantasy roguelike game using Unity and C#. In the game, you play as a wizard who is tasked with
            eliminating demons from the world and you must fight these demons using your elemental powers.
            I led the team in the completion of the game's level design and audio design. In practice this meant finding backgroud music
            that we could use under Creative Commons, and finding and then implementing the right sprites for the background as well as for some of the characters.
            A prototype of the game was built
            within about a week, from deciding on a game concept to completing the final build.
